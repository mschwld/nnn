`nlaunch` is an independent POSIX-compliant GUI application launcher shell script. To use it with `nnn` you need to mark the file executable and drop it somewhere in your `$PATH`.

It requires [`fzy`](https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy) to show a fuzzy drop-down menu.

To use `nlaunch` as an independent launcher add a keybind to open `nlaunch` in a terminal e.g.

    xfce4-terminal -e nlaunch
