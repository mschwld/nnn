# About
This software contains the great file manager nnn (original repository: [here](https://github.com/jarun/nnn). The only difference here is that i changed the keybindings to better suit my personal preferences. 

# Bindings changed:
- `,` for bookmarks (`SEL_BOOKMARK`)
- `x` for plugins (`SEL_PLUGIN`)
- `D` for deletion from selection buffer (`SEL_RM`)
- `V` for move from selection buffer (`SEL_MV`)
- `P` for copy from selection buffer (`SEL_CP`)
- `C-H` for toggle hidden files (`SEL_HIDDEN`)
- `.` for filter (`SEL_FLTR`)

# Bindings disabled:
- `SEL_SELMUL` 
- `SEL_MARK`
